    m_Localized: 'Scott chose not to show the full Alien for most of the film, keeping
      most of its body in shadow to create a sense of terror and heighten suspense.
      The audience could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest
      of the creature might look like:[22] "Every movement is going to be very slow,
      very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly
      what he looks like."[24] Scott said:'

    m_Localized: In ufology, Nordic aliens are humanoid extraterrestrials purported
      to come from the Pleiades who resemble Nordic-Scandinavians.[1] Professed contactees
      describe them as being six to seven feet tall (about two meters) with long
      blonde hair, blue eyes,[2] and fair skin.[3][2][4] Ufologist George Adamski
      is credited with being among the first to claim contact with Nordic aliens
      in the mid 1950s, and scholars note that the mythology of extraterrestrial
      visitation from beings with features described as Aryan often include claims
      of telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.[5][6][1]
